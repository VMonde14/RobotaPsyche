Idea for final project: 

Monkeys and Bananas: The bananas start off green and, overtime, they will get "ripe" (yellow) and then turn brown. The monkeys will wait until the bananas are yellow to eat them. There will be deviations in climbing speed (to get the banana) and ripening speed.
I feel like this might not be complex enough.
