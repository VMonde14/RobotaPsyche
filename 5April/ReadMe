i Robot takeaways: 

1. It's intresting how Susan refers to robota as a friend ("There was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend.") when they are so often portrayed in media as enemies or betrayers. 

2. This makes me think about the performance of emotions- what do we do to show we care, we're happy, we're mad, we're scared. Does it differ culturally? Andwhen it says "Robbie was hurt" was he actually hurt? Or did he make a performance of being hurt? 

3. I notice a generational difference- Mrs. Weston sees Robbie as a servant while Gloria sees him as a friend. Could this be because Gloria has grown up with Robbie? Or at least has been introduced to him at a younger age? Also, when he's dismissed, he's finally referred to as "the robot" rather than with his name or with descriptors. 

4. Runaround seemed more like the portrayal of robots that we've seen in media - they wanted Sepeedy back so they could fix him, not because of an emotional attachment. But at the end, it did seem like Speedy had emotions or at least remorse for his actions. But how do we know if this is genuine or performative? A way to invoke pity from the humans so they don't shut him down? 

5. I liked this description of the 3 rules of robotics, it makes a lot of sense how they worked through what was hindering Speedy and how to fix it. It's also interesting to see where the balance is between the three rules, whether they prioritize 2 or 3 more. Will there ever be a time when they stop prioritizing 1?
