15 February - FlowField project

I struggled with being able to view the flowfield AND still not see the trails of the vehicle.
I found that the flowField redrawing itself would darken the image a lot and also slow down the sketch. 
I wonder how to work around this? I'd love to be able to toggle the flowField visualization on and off.
