irobot - Reason 

1. "Mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact" What were the "mathematical squiggles" that made Cutie? Did they ever think that Cutie might cause these sort of problems? 
2. They named it Cutie! Maybe as an attempt to accept it more. Did they think giving it a sweet name would make it easier to work with? 
3. What is the detriment of Cutie believing in this "reglion" if there is any? If it still completes its job, who cares what it believes?
