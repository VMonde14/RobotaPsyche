Here are five topics for discussion based on the readings for this week: 

1. How urgent is the discussion on ethics regarding robots? Have there already been ethical dilemmas? How were they handled without a standard code of ethics? 
2. Should humanoid and nonhumanoid robots have different ethics applied to them? If not, would humanoid robots be given different ethics subconsciously anyway because of the morality they contain? 
3. A human is "What can put on a human performance in any social situation". Whoa whoa whoa. That's a definition I haven't heard before!
4. If we decide to "blame the robot" what will come of it? Are there understandable consequences that the robot can comprehend as "punishment"? Is it reprogramming? 
5. As I was reading, my mom texted me "I'd like to punch the grocery store robot" ...so...that's relevant. 
6. Just so much about how robots getting rights will affect civil rights movements for minorities. Like, if robots get rights before trans people get basic healthcare rights, or things like that, how will that impact the movement? It's two different realms- Tech vs. Social Science, but like it's kinda the same in this regard. If people start fighting for robots to be represented in court, but the US still doesn't give lawyers to children of immigrants who are being deported (for example), what happens? How much fuel would that add to civil rights movements? I don't think this is a coherent thought but my entire brain is screaming right now.
